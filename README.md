<h1 align="center">CSE Department Event Management System</h1>

<br>
The proposed system is a **CSE Department Event Management System (CDEMS)** that allows the administration, department, and students to efficiently organize, manage, and participate in department-related events such as workshops, seminars, sports, or cultural fests. The system will automate various processes, including event registration, notifications, schedules, feedback collection, and result announcements. This project idea can be developed step by step by applying the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** to ensure a high-quality system.

## Planning
  
**Objective**: Define the scope and purpose of the idea.

**Activities**:
- Identify the need for the project (e.g., ease of managing departmental events)
- Determine the target users (students, department, organizers).
- Outline key goals, such as organizing workshops, seminars, fests, and sports effectively.

## Requirements Analysis

**Objective**: Identify the expected features and constraints of the system.

**Activities**:
- List functional requirements (e.g., event scheduling, participant registration).
- Document non-functional requirements (e.g., user-friendly interface, file-based storage).
- Analyze potential challenges (e.g., limited resources, user adoption).

## Design

**Objective**: Visualize the structure and functionality of the system.

**Activities**:
- Sketch high-level mockups for the user interface (event calendar, registration forms).
- Plan how data will be structured and stored in files.
- Create diagrams to map workflows like event creation and participant registration.

## Conceptualization (In place of Implementation)

**Objective**: Develop the theoretical framework of the system.

**Activities**:
- Describe how the system would function in various scenarios.
- Specify the roles of users (admins vs. participants).
- Draft guidelines for how events would be managed and displayed.
